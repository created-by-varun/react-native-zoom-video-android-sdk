# Zoom Video SDK for React Native

## Installation

In your React Native project, install the Video SDK:

`$ npm install @zoom/react-native-videosdk --save`

In the iOS and Android folders in your project, you will also need to [install the iOS and Android Zoom Video SDKs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/react-native/getting-started#add-ios-or-android-sdk-to-wrapper), respectively.

## Usage

In the component file where you want to use the Video SDK, import `ZoomVideoSdkProvider`, `useZoom`, and `EventType`.

```js
import { ZoomVideoSdkProvider, useZoom,  EventType } from 'react-native-zoom-video-sdk';
```

Wrap your application with `ZoomVideoSdkProvider` and set the required configuration properties.

```js
{...}
return (
  <ZoomVideoSdkProvider
    config={{
    appGroupId: '{Your Apple Group ID here}',
    domain: 'zoom.us',
    enableLog: true,
  }}>
    <RestOfTheApp />
  </ZoomVideoSdkProvider>
)
```

Get the Video SDK instance.

```js
const zoom = useZoom();
```

Generate an [SDK JWT Token](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/auth).

Then, join a session.

```js
await zoom.joinSession({
  sessionName: 'name of video session',
  token: 'JWT goes here',
  username: 'name of user',
  audioOptions: {
    connect: true,
    mute: false,
  },
  videoOptions: {
    localVideoOn: true,
  },
  videoOptions: {
    localVideoOn: true,
  },
  sessionIdleTimeoutMins: 40,
});
```
